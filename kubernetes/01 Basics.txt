With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of 
those applications several times a day. Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to 
be released and updated in an easy and fast way without downtime. Kubernetes helps you make sure those containerized 
applications run where and when you want, and helps them find the resources and tools they need to work.
