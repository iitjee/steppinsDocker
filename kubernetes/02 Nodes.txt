A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, previously known as a minion

A node’s status contains the following information:
Addresses
Phase (deprecated)
Condition
Capacity
Info

The usage of these fields varies depending on your cloud provider or bare metal configuration.



Addresses:
- HostName: The hostname as reported by the node’s kernel. Can be overridden via the kubelet --hostname-override parameter.
- ExternalIP: Typically the IP address of the node that is externally routable (available from outside the cluster).
- InternalIP: Typically the IP address of the node that is routable only within the cluster.



Condition:
This field describes the status of all Running nodes.
 For example, the following response describes a healthy node.
        "conditions": [
          {
            "kind": "Ready",
            "status": "True"
          }
        ]
